This project was a great way of practicing lessons from TOP's foundation HTML and CSS. It was particularly rewarding in practicing flexbox. Also, I got the opportunity to use the dev tool to debug an overlay issue.  

Definitely, there's is still so much more I can. I'm on track to the JS foundational course. Yeyy! And see you there!
